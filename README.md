# Professional Portfolio
## Description
A working professional portfolio designed to give a brief introduction to myself and my work for potential future employers or clients.

The project was mainly focused on building skills in advanced CSS skills, such as flexbox, CSS variables and using media queries to ensure a responsive design overall for various devices.

I learned how flexbox is useful in creating column or grid layouts and how it is beneficial to use in making pages more responsive. I also learned that it is important to keep in mind that webpages are viewed across a variety of screen sizes and devices. 

Flex box was a challenging aspect for me during the building of this website, but I feel that after this assignment I have a better understanding and grasp on how it works. 
I would say though, that the most challenging part of this assignment was trying to make sure that the website was responsive and functional across multiple devices. I had instances where images would work on desktop, but not in landscape on a tablet! There was much trial and error for getting things to work across multiple devices. Although I think I have managed well for this assignment, there's much more for me to learn about compatibility across devices and browsers.
