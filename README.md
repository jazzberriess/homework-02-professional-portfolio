# Professional Portfolio
## Description
A working professional portfolio designed to give a brief introduction to myself and my work for potential future employers or clients.

The project was mainly focused on building skills in advanced CSS skills, such as flexbox, CSS variables and using media queries to ensure a responsive design overall for various devices.

I learned how flexbox is useful in creating column or grid layouts and how it is beneficial to use in making pages more responsive. I also learned that it is important to keep in mind that webpages are viewed across a variety of screen sizes and devices.
